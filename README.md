# Playground / Proving Ground for 'interview' questions

Random selection of programming questions and answers. 

## Background

I was having a discussion the other day about programming interview questions. 

My view is that the algorithmic, data-structures puzzle questions can be very 
limiting in terms of selecting candidates and are not very representative of 
the actual day to day life of an engineer. That communication, writing readable
code, a track record of success are more important.

Their argument was that these are still indicators of good programmers. Being able to answer
these algorithmic, O(n) complexity, data structures sort of questions, while not sufficient, are
necessary indicators. 

The conversation is interesting, and I took it as a challenge. Maybe I don't like those questions because I'm out of practice, so now I'm doing them :)
They are actually nice little katas to do in the morning to get in the mindset.

## My Arguments

Note these are mostly consumer web centric viewpoints. We can just generally spin up another instance.

- False negatives are rampant. People get nervous, the enivornment is strange, and can freeze. I've been here many times.
- I've been developing in the industry for nearly ten years. The **vast majority** of my time and I mean vast, is spent on refactoring, maintaining and cleaning code to adapt to changing business requirements. Of course, I'm more 'full stack' than backend (whatever that means), so it might be a misrepresentation. But I probably create two or three TRUE algorithmic methods a month. Most of my work is in object and function interaction.
- Preoptimization is dangerous. It's also an easy argument for those who need to present value. If I don't really know about a problem, but I want to look smart, I can always cite performance concerns.
- Performance is absolutely important, but it comes later and with data, not gut feelings. Write it so it works, write it with tests, then change it later.
- Developer performance is always more important than machine performance.
- Optimize the important and low hanging fruit, not just the fruit you are working on at the moment.
- Moore's law is over and concurrency is the future. 

## What I'm Learning

- This is a different mindset than I usually use. It takes a bit to context switch, but once that system is up and running, then I'm much more comfortable.
- My suspicion is that this will hopefully improve my day to day work.
- I still have so so so much to learn :)


## Testing

I also am writing a on the fly 'test harness' for now because often you don't get the luxury of using the tools you are used to in an interview
